# Climate Change
To practice what you’ve learned about window functions, you are going to use climate data from each state in the United States. A labeled map of the United States can be found [here](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/92/Map_of_USA_with_state_names_2.svg).

These data will show the average annual temperature for each state – this is the average temperature of every day in all parts of the state for that year.

For this project, you will be working with one table:

* `state_climate`

## Understanding the Data
1. Let’s see what our table contains by running the following command:
```
SELECT * 
FROM state_climate;
```

## Aggregate and Value Functions
2. Let’s start by looking at how the average temperature changes over time in each state.

Write a query that returns the `state`, `year`, `tempf` or `tempc`, and `running_avg_temp` (in either Celsius or Fahrenheit) for each state.

(The `running_avg_temp` should use a window function.)


3. Now let’s explore the lowest temperatures for each state.

Write a query that returns `state`, `year`, `tempf` or `tempc`, and the lowest temperature (`lowest_temp`) for each state.

Are the lowest recorded temps for each state more recent or more historic?


4. Like before, write a query that returns `state`, `year`, `tempf` or `tempc`, except now we will also return the highest temperature (`highest_temp`) for each state.

Are the highest recorded temps for each state more recent or more historic?

5. Let’s see how temperature has changed each year in each state.

Write a query to select the same columns but now you should write a window function that returns the `change_in_temp` from the previous year (no null values should be returned).

* Which states and years saw the largest changes in temperature?
* Is there a particular part of the United States that saw the largest yearly changes in temperature?

## Ranking Functions
6. Write a query to return a rank of the coldest temperatures on record (`coldest_rank`) along with `year`, `state`, and `tempf` or `tempc`. Are the coldest ranked years recent or historic? The coldest years should be from any state or year.


7. Modify your `coldest_rank` query to now instead return the `warmest_rank` for each state, meaning your query should return the warmest temp/year for each state. Again, are the warmest temperatures more recent or historic for each state?


8. Let’s now write a query that will return the average yearly temperatures in quartiles instead of in rankings for each state.

Your query should return `quartile`, `year`, `state` and `tempf` or `tempc`. The top quartile should be the coldest years.

Are the coldest years more recent or historic?


9. Lastly, we will write a query that will return the average yearly temperatures in quintiles (5).

Your query should return `quintile`, `year`, `state` and `tempf` or `tempc`. The top quintile should be the coldest years overall, not by state.

What is different about the coldest quintile now?
