# SQL Injections
In this article, you‚Äôll learn various SQL Injection techniques and strategies to mitigate these attacks.

When you log in to Codecademy, you provide a username and password which are used to authenticate you. But how does this work under the hood? When you provide these credentials, the Codecademy server will take your input and compare it against user data inside a database.

That step of checking the input against the database can be abused by attackers. Through a cleverly and carefully crafted input an attacker can inject code directly into the database query, getting precious data!

In this article, we‚Äôll be talking about SQL Injection, which is this type of attack on a SQL database. You will be introduced to:

* Different types of SQL Injection attacks
* Basic ways to mitigate SQL Injection attacks

## What are SQL Injections?
A SQL injection is a common vulnerability affecting applications that use SQL as their database language. A hacker can use their knowledge of the SQL language to cleverly construct text inputs that modify the backend SQL query to their liking. They can force the application to output private data or respond in ways that provide intel.

Using the following injection techniques, threat actors may be able to access information they shouldn‚Äôt have, change database records, or even take complete control of the system!

## Union-Based Injections
A union-based injection leverages the power of the SQL keyword `UNION`. `UNION` allows us to take two separate `SELECT` queries and combine their results. Union-based injections can allow an attacker to quickly steal information from a system.

Let‚Äôs look at an example.

Say this is how the query is created when a customer searched for a product name (USER_INPUT):
```
query = "SELECT product_name, product_cost, product_description FROM product_table WHERE product_name = " + USER_INPUT + "'";
```
If the attacker enters a user input such as this:
```
soap' UNION SELECT username,password,NULL FROM user_table;-- -
```
This input would create a valid SQL statement that grabs information for ‚Äúsoap‚Äù but UNIONS all the usernames and passwords of the users!
```
SELECT product_name, product_cost, product_description FROM
product_table WHERE product_name = 'soap' UNION SELECT username,password,NULL FROM user_table;-- -';
```
Notice the strategic placement of the ' character that allows the attacker to insert SQL syntax and extend the SQL query!

## Error-Based Injections
In an error-based injection, an attacker writes a SQL query to force the application to return an error message with sensitive data.

Let‚Äôs take a look at the example below from an [actual vulnerability](https://packetstormsecurity.com/files/138790/Dolphin-7.3.0-SQL-Injection.html). In this example, the attacker‚Äôs input causes an error that spits out the password.
```
asdf' UNION select 1, exp(~(select*from(SELECT Password FROM profiles WHERE ID=1)x)); -- -
```
### SQL query:
```
SELECT user_id FROM users WHERE username='asdf' UNION select 1, exp(~(select*from(SELECT Password FROM profiles WHERE ID=1)x)); -- -
```
SQL completes that inside statement getting the password for the profile `ID 1`, but errors on the value type that should be returned. This is the error that accidentally gives away the password!
```
Database access error. Description: DOUBLE value is out of range in 'exp(~((select 'SUP3r_S3cur3_P@a55w0rd!' from dual)))'<?xml version='1.0' encoding='UTF-8'?><ray><result value="Error saving setting." status="failed" /></ray>
```
## Boolean-Based Injections
Boolean-based injections involve SQL statements that can confirm TRUE/FALSE questions about the database. When using this method, the attacker take note of the difference in the application‚Äôs response (changes in HTML, HTTP response code, or other web session data) when the result of their question is true or false.

Suppose a website has a search box that will return the username and email of a specific user ID. The SQL query below is used:
```
SELECT username, email FROM users WHERE id = '[USER INPUT]';
```
In a normal search for `id 1` , the website will give back the username admin and email `admin@site.com `and display everything as normal.

Someone sneaky can use the `AND` keyword to see what happens on the website when the SQL statement is false.

For example, if the search input was this,
```
1' AND '1' = '2
```
and this was the SQL query that was run,
```
SELECT username, email FROM users WHERE id = '1' AND '1' = '2';
```
We won‚Äôt be getting a username and email back, since `1` is never equal to `2`. At this point, the attacker makes note of what happens on the website when the statement is false.

The attacker would also make note of what happens when the modified SQL statement is true (`1` is always equal to `1`).
```
SELECT username, email FROM users WHERE id = '1' AND '1' = '1';
```
Using this technique with the `AND` keyword, the attacker could write in any boolean statement on the other side of the `AND`, and based on the website‚Äôs response figure out if the statement is true.

Boolean injections are often used to figure out the name of a database table (possibly to build up for a Union-based injection), manipulating one query at a time to confirm one character at a time.

## Time-Based Injections
Not all SQL injections will provide visible output. A time-based injection makes use of several built-in SQL functions, such as `SLEEP()` and `BENCHMARK()`, to cause visible delays in an application‚Äôs response time. While the output of a command isn‚Äôt visible, delays in the response time can be used to infer some information!

Suppose we have a database query that will check to see if a certain username USER exists within the database.
```
SELECT id FROM users WHERE username = 'USER';
```
Someone could write this SQL syntax as the text input to confirm if the admin‚Äòs password is `P@ssw0rd123`
```
a' OR IF((SELECT password FROM users WHERE username='admin')='P@ssw0rd123', SLEEP(5), NULL);-- -
```
making the SQL query:
```
SELECT id FROM users WHERE username = 'a' OR IF((SELECT password FROM users WHERE username='admin')='P@ssw0rd123', SLEEP(5), NULL);-- -';
```
If there‚Äôs a 5-second delay before a response from the server, an attacker could confirm the `admin` user had a password of `P@ssw0rd123`.

## Out-of-Band SQL Injections
Out-of-Band injections are generally the rarest and most difficult injections to execute for attackers. Unlike the other methods, which return the results via the web application, an out-of-band injection will leverage a new channel to retrieve information from a query.

Generally, these SQL injections will cause the database server to send HTTP or DNS requests containing SQL query results to an attacker-controlled server. From there, the attacker could review the log files to identify the query results.

Again, these injections are extremely difficult to execute. They rely on permissions to database functions that are most often disabled, and would have to bypass firewalls that might stop requests to the attacker‚Äôs server.

**Multiple choice**
While testing a web application you try out SQL injection into input boxes. You find you‚Äôre unable to get visible output, but you notice that you can cause the database to delay its response. Which type of SQL injection would you use to gather additional information from this database?

```
(Selected)Correct:
Time-Based Injection

Out-of-Band Injection

Boolean Injection

Error-Based Injection
```

üëè
Correct!

# SQL Injection Prevention
There are two main methods for preventing injection attacks: sanitization and prepared statements.

## Sanitization
Sanitization is the process of removing dangerous characters from user input. When it comes to SQL injections, we would want to escape dangerous characters such as:

* '
* ;
* \--

These sorts of characters can allow attackers to extend queries to output more data from a database.

While this does provide a layer of protection, this method isn‚Äôt perfect. If a user finds a way to bypass your sanitization process, they can easily inject data into your system.

Additionally, depending on your query, removing certain characters may have no effect! Therefore, this shouldn‚Äôt be your only defense mechanism.

## Prepared Statements
Writing prepared statements in backend code is a common, reliable, and secure solution against SQL injections. Prepared statements are nearly foolproof.

How does it work? We provide the database the query we want to execute in advance. First, the database processes our query. Then we pass in the parameters/user input. Any input, regardless of whether the content has SQL syntax, is then treated only as a parameter and will not be treated as SQL code.

Here is an example of what a prepared statement looks like in PHP web application backend code:
```
$username= $_GET['user'];
$stmt = $conn->prepare("SELECT * FROM Users WHERE name = '?'");
$stmt->bind_param("s", $username);
$stmt->execute();
```
In addition to providing added security, prepared statements also make queries far more efficient.

Which of these is an example of input sanitization?

Programming a firewall to drop network packets containing potential SQL injection attacks

Passing user input as parameters to a pre-prepared statement

Cleaning out sensitive user data from requests

(Selected)Correct:
Removing characters such a ', ;, and \-- to prevent them from impacting a query
```
üëè
That‚Äôs right! Input sanitization removes characters that have the ability to manipulate SQL queries from the frontend user input.

**Multiple choice**
```
Which of these is a benefit of prepared statements?

Prepared statements will add a limit to the amount of information returned by a statement if the SQL query could potentially return too much data.

(Selected)Correct:
Prepared statements improve query efficiency, while also adding additional security when implemented properly.

They are 100% secure from SQL injection attacks, regardless of how they are implemented.

Prepared statements active search through the input and remove potentially dangerous characters.
```
üëè
Correct! If implemented properly, they make sure only the expected SQL queries are performed.
